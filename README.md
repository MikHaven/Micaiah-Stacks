# Micaiah-Stacks
Micaiah built Stacks for Education
Stacks is like Jenga, but for Educational purposes.

Blocks are data loaded from the Commmon Core of an example student.
Based on the data, you can have Glass, Wood, or Stone Blocks

"Break All Glass" Was the requested feature to show how knowledge builds on and must learn and than master topics so you don't topple your education with a concept you don't fully understand.

The example data had 6th, 7th, 8th Grades, along with Algerba I.
